                <p>The pandemic has changed life as we knew it. It has forced us to change the way we live our lives and
                    conduct our businesses. The crisis has impacted all businesses pushing everyone to adapt their plan
                    and strategies - perhaps for the long haul.</p> <br>
                <p>Among others, the marketers too are taking stock of their situation to prepare quickly for the year
                    ahead, after their best laid plans have been disrupted by the COVID 19. While the wide scale
                    inoculation is a sign of optimism, the economic impact and the work towards stabilization if far
                    from over. For the marketers, it calls for a right mix of technology and creativity to catapult the
                    marketing engine to action.</p> <br>
                <p>In this blog, we will take a look at how the future of marketing is likely to change forever.</p>
                <br>

                    <div class="para-with-image">
                        <h3>Digital experiences will take top priority</h3> <br>
                        <p>Digital Customer Experience is a sum total of every customer touchpoint with your brand -
                            online. With nearly all (if not all) of your customers shifting to digital avenues for their
                            everyday interaction and operations, it’s a no-brainer that this is your first and immediate
                            step to your marketing pivot. </p> <br>
                        <p>Crafting a digital customer experience of clarity and intention is indispensable. Whether you
                            are dealing with the front lines of dealing with a customer or building intelligence at the
                            backend, to nurture your sales, digital experience is everything one needs to raise the
                            stakes. Companies need to map their customer journeys meticulously in order to create unique
                            and meaningful digital customer experiences to sync every step of your prospect and
                            customer’s interaction with your brand.</p>
                    </div>

                </div> <br>
                <h3>Return to the fundamentals</h3> <br>
                <p> Over the last few years, there have been many flash in the pan successes that marketing rode on, by
                    means of quick hacks to grab eyeballs. However, just a stint is not more good enough or long
                    standing. Most of the companies that emerged successful in marketing the last couple of years are
                    those that had a strong foundation to their game with fundamentals. That approach to marketing with
                    a firm grip on the 4Ps and an endeavour to consistent and accurate responses will resume
                    significance. </p> <br>
                <p> Marketing structuring will take on a more marathon effort, over a sprint rush. Companies will have
                    to double down on customer data, delivery standards and agility of the initiatives to tackle
                    oncoming unpredictability. In-housing content management system and creative teams are also likely
                    to return for better flexibility and control at a lower cost. </p> <br>
                <h3>Data in the driver seat</h3> <br>
                <p>Data, combined with technology is currently driving much of the revolution businesses today.
                    Marketers who were once communication experts are now required to be experience experts in the need
                    to rise up to the personalization of prospect and customer experience. While marketing was always
                    the epicentre of acquiring, analysing, translating, and leveraging data, the sheer volume, velocity
                    and variety of data from multichannel mediums has necessitated a relook at the approach.</p> <br>
                <p>As the channels of marketing are growing more interactive, there is dire need use data extensively to
                    feed the right commands for accuracy. Data-driven marketing has proven to be time efficient and
                    driving a higher rate of engagement and conversion. </p>
                <p>Integrating disparate data to making sense of it for an informed action on how to engage with their
                    target audience will remain a significant shift to the process of marketing for decades to come.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Retention marketing is here to stay</h3> <br>
                <p>Customer confidence is on decline and competition on ascent – both making the marketplace the more
                    challenging than ever. Not only is the task of engaging and attracting new buyers cumbersome, it is
                    also terribly expensive; almost five times over than retaining an existing customer.</p> <br>
                <p>A big marketing strategy of successful companies will involve leveraging customer loyalty and
                    retention over seeking new prospects. Apart from the classic loyalty engagement activities like
                    points, discounts and perks, we are likely to see growing trend towards adding more value for every
                    buck the customer spends. A range of value offerings which are content-rich are likely to shape up
                    retention marketing. Onboarding programs, content pool access, customized product, refresher
                    programs community element, personalized experience are some measures that’ll support sustainable
                    growth. </p> <br>
                <h3>Messaging that matters</h3> <br>
                <p>The last couple of years has brought home realization that customers are, despite everything, people
                    – with emotions. In keeping with the general sentiments, brands are compelled if not moved, to
                    revisit their messaging from a tone-deaf promotional stance to a more empathetic one. Also,
                    organizations have garnered a significant role as an extension of the society in the recent past,
                    requiring them to take a firm stance on political and social issues, with a power to steer the
                    choice of its customers. Establishing and emphasizing the company’s values across customer-facing
                    touch points will continue to be the seismic shift in playbook of marketing strategies.</p> <br>
                <p>For immediate respite, organizations are taking swift steps to recover lost time, missed revenue and
                    forge new business goals. Some of the popular pivots include.. </p> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Empathetic messaging</li>
                    <li>Reduced non-essential expenses</li>
                    <li>Short term budgeting</li>
                    <li>Increased in cross functional collaboration</li>
                    <li>Virtual events and networking activities</li>
                </ul> <br>
                <p>Regardless of the unforeseeable, the future of marketing looks very dynamic in the coming years. So
                    does the role of a CMO who will be wielding the combined strength of content, data, direction and
                    technology to drive desired business outcomes. The definite takeaway from the recent crisis is that
                    marketing was, and will be, the first line of response in an untoward event- be it to express
                    solidarity, establish faith or extend support. Organizations will have to maintain a steady focus
                    creating a non-fungible customer experience in order to achieve long-term growth.</p>
