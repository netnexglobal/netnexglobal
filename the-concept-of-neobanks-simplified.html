                <br>
                <p>Even as traditional banking are doing away with redundant and cumbersome functioning, tiring queues
                    and mountains of paperwork moving into the digital space, a new league of non-bank fintechs are
                    making news.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Giving a chase for the digital banks are neobanks which are combating the digital-first strategy
                    towards a digital-only strategy promising a world of seamless banking experience. Neobanks are
                    fintechs that offer applications, software and other technologies to streamline digital banking.
                    Generally they offer or specialize in one or few financial products like checking and savings
                    accounts, lending and loans, micro-finance or may cater to a specific market or segment like SMBs,
                    individuals, corporate employees etc. As they operate only via digital platforms, they tend to be
                    more nimble, transparent and cost effective than their traditional counterparts.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>To put it quite simply, a Neo bank is an online-only bank. Though Neobanks are essentially
                    online-only banking platforms that do not have branches, they are not to be confused with online
                    banks (as they often are). Online or digital banks are often the online subsidiary of a traditional
                    banks operating as a regulated player in the banking sector providing a broader spectrum of banking
                    services to a versatile range of customer segments. A neobank, on the other hand, exists solely
                    online — without any physical branches and independently or in partnership with traditional banks.

                    <div class="para-with-image">
                        <h3>What does the future of Neobanking look like?
                        </h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Focused on low-cost banking, supported by intuitive technologies and real-time, responsive
                            interactions, Neobank is a welcome alternative to customers weary of traditional banking
                            methods. Platformed on a complete digital infrastructure, Neobanks holds the potential for a
                            far superior customer service and much lower banking charges than its traditional
                            competitors. Even as the larger population is being inducted into digital banking (strongly
                            propelled by the recent pandemic), online-only banks but naturally, are attracting a massive
                            following. Further, the low cost models with less or no fees, greater transparency of
                            operations and flexible product offerings of neobanks are attracting millennials, micro,
                            small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and those having sporadic incomes and earnings or
                            seeking specific offerings.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ffm-image ">

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With the comprehensive intelligence into consumer behaviour, neobanks also have the potential to
                    offer hyper-enhanced and personalized customer experience tailoring product(s) and service for
                    specific customer needs. Deeper technology penetration in these business models also allows for a
                    more timely and transparent support - at an affordable cost.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The global neobank market was worth USD 18.6 billion in 2018 and is expected to accelerate at a
                    compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 46.5% between 2019 and 2026, generating around USD
                    394.6 billion by 2026 <a href="https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/neo-and-challenger-bank-market"></a> While
                    neobanks have certainly become a buzz word and a fascinating concept among the young, it is still
                    not accepted by masses with concerns on safety and reliability concerns. Also, regulatory and
                    compliance factors are inhibiting the growth and success of neobanks in the financial space. It is
                    interesting to note, in India, the RBI remains firm on prioritizing a bank's physical presence and
                    banking licenses are not given to digital only banks. To deal with this regulatory predicament, it
                    has necessitated Neobanks to operate with the support of existing traditional banking partners who
                    hold banking licenses.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, it is also a wait &amp; watch to see how the customers warm up to interacting and investing in a
                    financial institution that is completely online, pulling away from years of conditioning of in-
                    person banking especially on larger accounts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Understandable, there is rise in partnerships between neobanks and traditional banks. The hybrid
                    model combining the technical proficiency and customization offerings of a neobank with the security
                    and reliability of a traditional bank has evolved to be a strategic partnership model for the future
                    of banking. This has heralded a win-win for both the banking businesses and the customers by
                    combining the best of both worlds.
                </p>
                <p>Neobanks emerged in response to the digital era holding great promise to a very personalized, cost
                    effective and customer centric approach to traditional banking. While the road ahead for neobanks is
                    still bumpy, it is certainly on the fast lane to revolutionizing banking as we know it. Moreover, in
                    an industry that has long needed a renewed approach to service, neobanks warrant considerable
                    progress.</p>
